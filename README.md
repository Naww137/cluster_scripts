# Welcome!

This repository is developed and maintained by members of Vladimir Sobes' research group at the University of Tennessee's Nuclear Engineering Departement. This repository is a simple one, meant to host helpful tips and example scripts for navigating the UTK NE computing cluster and leveraging its capabilities to accelerate researcvh endeavors.

The official cluster wiki can be found [here](https://necluster.ne.utk.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page). The basics are covered there, however, many quarks and nuances are not fully described. (pun intended) It is the goal of this repository to host working bash or other scripts examples as well as useful tips, tricks, and troubleshooting ideas gathered over the years.


### Useful tips

- if submitting many jobs, look into using job arrays. There should be an example shell script in this repository.

### Trouble shooting notes

- interactive jobs (qsubi) will not work if X11 forwarding is not enabled for your ssh connection
